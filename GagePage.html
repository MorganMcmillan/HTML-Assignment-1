                    Warframes main gameplay consists of completing missions, in which you fight hordes of enemies while trying to complete an objective such as rescuing a hostage, hacking a system or assassinating a target. Warframe allows for extremely fast paced movement and dynamic playstyles, with a mix of character abilities and hundreds of weapons, both ranged and melee. Before entering a mission, you can choose if you want your matchmaking to be public, allowing random players to join, or private, playing with only the people in your party. After a mission you will return to your orbiter, a ship that functions as your home base and includes your armory, fabricator and other systems to help you progress. From your orbiter you can access the Starchart, a map of the solar system.

Your account also has an overall level or "Master Rank" which levels up through the culmnated affinity of all of your pieces of equipement. A higher Mastery Rank allows you to access more planets and weapons, however all warframes can be used from any mastery rank level if you've built them.
