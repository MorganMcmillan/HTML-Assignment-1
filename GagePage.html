            </h2>
            <p>
                Warframes main gameplay consists of completing missions, in which you fight hordes of enemies while trying to complete an objective such as rescuing a hostage, hacking a system or assassinating a target. Warframe allows for extremely fast paced movement and dynamic playstyles, with a mix of character abilities and hundreds of weapons, both ranged and melee. Before entering a mission, you can choose if you want your matchmaking to be public, allowing random players to join, or private, playing with only the people in your party. After a mission you will return to your orbiter, a ship that functions as your home base and includes your armory, fabricator and other systems to help you progress. From your orbiter you can access the Starchart, a map of the solar system.

                Alongside progressing through the games various missions and unlocking the avaliable planets, the players progress is tracked through Affinity. By killing enemies and completing objectives you will gain affinity for the weapons, warframes and companions used, allowing you to attach more upgrades too it. Your account also has an overall level or "Master Rank" which levels up through the culmnated affinity of all of your pieces of equipement. A higher Mastery Rank allows you to access more planets and weapons, however all warframes can be used from any mastery rank level if you've built them.
