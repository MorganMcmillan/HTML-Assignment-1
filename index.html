        <section><h2>About</h2>
            <p>This site is a collection of random Wiki articles that three group members made for a web development project. Each has nothing to do with each other and only reflects the interests of the individuals who made them.</p>

            <h2>Morgan's Page</h2>
            <a href="Morgan-Mcmillan-Lua.html">The Lua Programming Language</a>
            <p>I chose Lua for my page because it's the first programming language I ever learned, and because it's relevant to the field of computer programming.</p>

            <a href="GagePage.html">Warframe</a>
            <p>The top of my page is an introduction to Warframe because I'm addicted to it and I believe its a game that needs more recognition for how good it is.</p>
